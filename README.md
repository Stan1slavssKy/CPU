# CPU

## What is this project?

A processor is a project that processes your assembly commands. For example, you enter push 5 and to begin with, this line will be assembled and then processed by my processor, which will create and fill the stack.

## How to use it?

If you want to use this program you need to download directory CPU.

Then you need to compile assembler and then cpu. 

You can do it like that: 
                          
                           cd assembler
                           make
                           cd ..
                           cd cpu   
                           make
Sorry for two make in one project in next update I promise to fix that.
