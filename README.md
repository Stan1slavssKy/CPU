# CPU
If you want to use this program you need to download directory CPU.

Then you need to compile assembler and then cpu. 

You can do this like that: 
                          
                           cd assem–∏ler
                           make
                           cd ..
                           cd cpu   
                           make
Sorry for two make in one project in next update I promise to fix that.
